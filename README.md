# Stupid-Jokes-API
JokeAPI-Based Joke Fetcher

This is a simple program built for the Flatiron Phase 1 Final Project. It lets you fetch jokes from the JokeAPI and display them in a user-friendly way.

How it Works

This program uses GET requests to the JokeAPI to fetch jokes, which it then shows to you. Here's how to use it:

Choose Your Joke Type: Just click on the button for the type of joke you want.

Enjoy the Laughter: The joke you picked will appear in the box below the buttons for you to enjoy.

Error Handling: If something goes wrong, you'll see an error message in the box, and all the error details will be logged in the console so you can figure out what happened.

Insightful Console: The console gives you info about the fetch request and all the details about the joke you got, which can help if you run into any issues.

Safe Mode

To keep things friendly, there's a safe mode switch. When you turn it on, the program will filter out jokes that could be offensive or inappropriate. However, jokes are user uploaded and user tagged, if a joke it imporperly tagged it can slip past the filter.
